     <h2>Enlem Sea Food Project Details</h2>
          <p>
           For Enlem Sea Food, I've made the server setup, Wordpress and database installations as back-end development. As part of front-end development, I implemented a work on Bootstrap framework in shades that generally match the terms aqua and fishing, suitable for the corporate look. </p>
         <p>
           I worked to include all content and products of the company on the site, and in addition, I've made the shootings of product and facility photos.</p>
